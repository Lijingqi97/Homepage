I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Liverpool, and I'm pleased to work with my supervisors [Prof. Chao HUANG](https://chaohuang2018.github.io/main/) and [Prof. Bei PENG](https://beipeng.github.io/). Before I came to the UK, I received my Master’s degree at Beihang University in 2023, I acquired my Bachelor’s degree at Northwest Polytechnical University in 2020 and was recommended by the academic committee to master’s degree study with the exemption of examination.

My research interests lie broadly in reliable and intelligent control method on autonomous system, including but not limited to decision, planning and control.
