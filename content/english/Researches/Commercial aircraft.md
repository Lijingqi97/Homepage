description: 'To establish the future autonomous air traffic management system, waypoint decisions must be integrated into trajectory planning to extend trajectory flexibility. However, designing an effective method for this problem is challenging as the synthesis of discrete decisions and continuous aircraft dynamics is NP-hard, besides, the complex and irregular layout of waypoints poses additional adaptivity performance for the method. This project focuses on the intercontinental long-range flight phase of commercial aircraft with route constraints and studies the waypoint decision autonomy in 4D trajectory planning based on intelligent methods.

  - Aircraft Autonomous Trajectory Generation
---
In the future, the aircraft trajectory will be co-determined by the commercial aircraft and air traffic management system in the concept of Four-Dimensional Trajectory-Based Operation (4D-TBO). Flight safety is crucial for aviation activities, and the commercial aircraft trajectory must pass through waypoints so that the whole flight is supervised by ground facilities.

Therefore, to establish the future autonomous air traffic management system, waypoint decisions must be integrated into trajectory planning to extend trajectory flexibility. However, designing an effective method for this problem is challenging as the synthesis of discrete decisions and continuous aircraft dynamics is NP-hard, besides, the complex and irregular layout of waypoints poses additional adaptivity performance for the method.

This project focuses on the intercontinental long-range flight phase of commercial aircraft with route constraints and studies the waypoint decision autonomy in 4D trajectory planning based on intelligent methods. Considering the different phases of the trajectory, this project can be saperate into two parts, the first one aims to reference trajectory before the flight and the second one aims to the operation trajectory during the in-flight phase.
